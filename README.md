NSAP Eligibility Prediction using Multi-Class Classification

üìå Project Overview :

- The National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) provides financial assistance to elderly, widows, and disabled individuals from below-poverty-line households. Manual eligibility verification is time-consuming and prone to errors.cThis project uses Machine Learning (Multi-Class Classification) to predict the most appropriate NSAP scheme for applicants based on demographic and socio-economic features.

The solution: 
- Automates scheme prediction ensures faster, transparent processing is deployed on IBM Watson Machine Learning (WML) for scalability.
